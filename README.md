# TIme_Weather_API
This is an application that displays time, and weather using a REST API.  This was created with Tkinter  for the GUI. I have an API key id already in the program that I used to grab the data (but for security purposes) I had to change it.
If you want your own Id key go to https://home.openweathermap.org/ and create a account
